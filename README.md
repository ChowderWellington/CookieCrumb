CookieCrumb is a silly program!

You can build stuff using shapes, create characters, and quite a bit more!

btw the github source code is a very old version, like 1.0. I think. so in more recent versions i'll put the source code in a folder so you can edit it

actually i think the source code is in the X86 Program Files
